            <h2>Why is there conflict between Isreal and Palestine?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Conflict between Israelis and Palestinians boiled over this week, escalating rapidly into one of the worst rounds of
                violence between the two sides in the last several years.
            
                An already tense situation prompted by moves to evict Palestinian families from their homes near the Old City in
                Jerusalem exploded at one of the holiest sites in the city, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as
                the
                Temple Mount.
                Israeli police entered the Al Aqsa Mosque and clashed with Palestinians inside the sacred site, firing stun grenades
                while Palestinians threw stones.
                The resulting clashes there and in other parts of the Old City left hundreds of Palestinians and some Israeli police
                officers injured. Palestinian militant groups in Gaza joined the fray by firing rockets into Israel, which responded
                with airstrikes.
                A United Nations representative warned the situation was "escalating towards a full-scale war."
                Since then, hundreds more rockets have been fired by Palestinian militant groups from Gaza and Israel has stepped up
                its
                artillery and airstrike bombardment of the territory. Israel has also called up reservists, fueling fears of an
                imminent
                ground invasion in Gaza.
                Meanwhile, several cities in Israel have been rocked by rioting and violent clashes between Arab and Jewish
                citizens.
                Putting a lid on the violence may not be easy. Political, religious, and nationalist factors all play a role in the
                situation.

            <h2>What Are The Officials Saying?</h2>
            
            <p>
                The effort to evict Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood has been widely criticized.
                State Department spokesman Ned Price said in early May that the United States is "deeply concerned about the
                potential
                eviction of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighborhoods of Jerusalem, many of whom have lived in
                their homes for generations. As we have consistently said, it is critical to avoid steps that exacerbate tensions or
                take us farther away from peace. This includes evictions in East Jerusalem, settlement activity, home demolitions,
                and
                acts of terrorism."
